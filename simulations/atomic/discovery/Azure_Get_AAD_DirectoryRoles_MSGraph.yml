  description: |
    A threat actor might want to list the directory roles that are activated in the tenant via Microsoft Graph APIs and the right permissions. This operation only returns roles that have been activated. A role becomes activated when an admin activates the role using the Activate directoryRole API. Not all built-in roles are initially activated.
