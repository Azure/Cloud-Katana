Unlocking Serverless Computing to Assess Security Controls

![](resources/images/Logo.png)

## About

Cloud Katana is a cloud native tool developed from the need to automate the execution of simulation steps in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. This tool is an event-driven, serverless compute application built on the top of [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) that expedites the research process and assessment of security controls. We are currently covering use cases in Azure, but we are working on extending it to other cloud providers.

## Documentation

Our official documentation is built with [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)!
