# Cloud Katana

Unlocking ServerlessÂ Computing toÂ Assess Security Controls

![](images/KatanaDesign.png)

## About

Cloud Katana is a cloud native tool developed from the need to automate simulation steps on-demand in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments. This tool is an event-driven, serverless compute application built on the top of [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) that expedites the research process and validation of security controls.
